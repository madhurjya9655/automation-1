# automation-1
This project automates email sending using Python. It reads email addresses from an Excel file, constructs an HTML email, and sends it to each recipient individually via the SMTP protocol. Useful for bulk email campaigns, notifications, or any automated email scenario, the project leverages pandas for Excel handling and smtplib for email sending.
